    <h5>Materials Used</h5>

    <h5>The Analysis</h5>
    <p>The SAP2000 Application modeled the bridge that we built, which was basedd loosely off of the Tokyo Gate Bridge. All of the joints were also modelled in the Application. Loads were then applied to the top of the model to determine how much weight the popsicle stick bridge could sustain.</p>
